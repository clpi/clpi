## About Me

I like authority, I like social hierarchy, and I don't shy from being characterized as a contrarian, 
  and I'll never shy away from a good conversation.

> [!Hint]
>
> As of the last four+ years, software engineering has been my bread and butter.
> However, I went to school for materials science & engineering and graduated,
> and in the process, I bolstered my existing SWE knowledge and believe that as such,
> I could bring a cross-disciplinary perspective to any team.

## Major Projects

### [down.lua](https://github.com/clpi/down.lua)

`word.lua` has simple goals, but a large ceiling. Fundamentally, a functional, extensibile, and top-tier convenience 
and familiarity with the workflow, and most importanlty, the language -- markdown. I have found so many highly-extensible
note-taking or life organization tools, often but not always embedded in plugin packages, but with a whole other filetype
and syntax that must become second nature before any of the fruits of extensibility are reached. My goal, beyond making
a nifty and time-saving familiar plugin for Neovim, is to bring back the two core aspects of a note-taking environment
aimed at most developers -- don't reeinvent the wheel, but bestow as much power possible to allow it to happen.

### [unitled t1d project](#)

as a type 1 diabetic, frankly since my diagnosis only as a small child, I have always wanted to do anything to help
either contribute or better understand this nightmarishly complicated field. Insulin pumps, at least those I've been
using, are overdue for a change that would surely bring at least my own life-saving device from something of the stone
ages. But regardless, at this point in the project, it's more ideation and research than anything else.
